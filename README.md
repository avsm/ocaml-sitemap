# ocaml-sitemap

This OCaml library provides functionality to generate XML sitemaps, which are
useful for SEO and search engines to better understand the structure of your
website.  Only generation is supported; PRs to support parsing input sitemaps
are welcome.

For more information on sitemaps, see the
[Sitemaps protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).
